This is a bot i made for my own convenience

You need to change the api keys and use your own keys in bot.json 

once that done run by typing node .

The Discord bot connection part was originaly made by https://github.com/devPhytols
I cloned this project from them because i wanted an imgur bot that can upload images for me using discord bot
but it grew into something more, i modified the original code so it can take more image formats and gifs, also it can now take image attachments, just copy the image you want to upload select the image option when typing /imgur and paste the image you wanna upload

I also added some other slash commands like a command to know the weather in any city, a pruge command to delete messages, and another command that can give you information about anime using the MAL api
